# Transducers prototype

Prototyping [transducers](https://clojure.org/reference/transducers), [type-classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class), and [monad-transformers](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Monad_transformers) for [language-ext](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext).  This is not for human consumption, nor is it supported.  These prototypes will see the light of day in [language-ext](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext) eventually.
